# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The purpose of this repository is to practice requirement analysis, which focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analysing, and structuring requirements.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyses, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.

It is the process of identifying, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It involves understanding what the system should do, the constraints under which it must operate, and the features that will satisfy business objectives.

It is typically the first and most crucial phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), because errors or gaps at this stage can spread across the entire project, leading to wasted effort, cost overruns, or project failure.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Prevents Scope Creep:** Scope creep happens when new features or changes are added to a project without proper evaluation or approval, often leading to delays and cost overruns. Through thorough requirement analysis, all project needs are defined, agreed upon, and documented early in the process. This makes it easier to control changes, prioritise features, and ensure the project stays on track.

- **Provides a Strong Foundation for Design, Development, and Testing:** Requirement Analysis creates a clear blueprint of what the system should do and how it should behave. Without this foundation, teams risk misalignment, leading to incomplete or low-quality software.

- **Enables Accurate Cost and Time Estimation:** A well-documented set of requirements helps project managers estimate resources, effort, and timelines more precisely. If requirements are vague or incomplete, cost and time projections may be unrealistic, resulting in budget overruns or missed deadlines.

- **Ensures Clarity and Understanding:** Requirement Analysis acts as a communication bridge between stakeholders (users, business managers, and the development team). It eliminates ambiguity by translating stakeholder needs into clear, structured, and testable requirements.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
### Requirement Gathering
- This is the initial step where raw information is collected from stakeholders about what they need in the system.
- It involves identifying all relevant stakeholders (e.g., clients, end-users, managers) and understanding their expectations.
- Techniques used include surveys, interviews, reviewing existing documents, studying current systems, and observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
- The goal is to compile a comprehensive list of desired features, constraints, and objectives.

### Requirement Elicitation
- Elicitation goes beyond just collecting requirements; it focuses on drawing out detailed needs from stakeholders.
- Since users may not always know how to articulate their needs, elicitation uses techniques like workshops, brainstorming, prototyping, focus groups, use case analysis, and observation.
- The goal is to uncover hidden, implicit, and critical requirements that may not be obvious during basic gathering.

### Requirement Documentation 
- All gathered and elicited requirements are recorded in a structured format, usually in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
- It involves creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
- It also involves creating user stories and use cases.
- The goal is to create a single source of truth that guides design, development, and testing.

### Requirement Analysis and Modelling
- This step focuses on examining and refining requirements to ensure they are feasible, complete, and logically structured.
- It often involves classifying requirements (functional, non-functional, domain-specific), checking for conflicts, and prioritising features.
- It also involves carrying out feasibility analysis in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
- Modelling techniques like use case diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, process flows, and prototypes are used to visually represent the system.
- The goal is to transform raw requirements into a structured and analyzable format for better understanding and decision-making.

### Requirement Validation
- After analysis and documentation, requirements must be verified to ensure they accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are technically feasible.
- Techniques include walkthroughs, reviews, prototyping, and stakeholder sign-off.
- Validation checks requirements for accuracy, completeness, consistency, and testability.
- The goal is to confirm that the requirements are correct, agreed upon, and ready to serve as the foundation for design and development.
