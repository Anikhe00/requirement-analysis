# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The purpose of this repository is to practice requirement analysis, which focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analysing, and structuring requirements.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyses, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.

It is the process of identifying, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It involves understanding what the system should do, the constraints under which it must operate, and the features that will satisfy business objectives.

It is typically the first and most crucial phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), because errors or gaps at this stage can spread across the entire project, leading to wasted effort, cost overruns, or project failure.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Prevents Scope Creep:** Scope creep happens when new features or changes are added to a project without proper evaluation or approval, often leading to delays and cost overruns. Through thorough requirement analysis, all project needs are defined, agreed upon, and documented early in the process. This makes it easier to control changes, prioritise features, and ensure the project stays on track.

- **Provides a Strong Foundation for Design, Development, and Testing:** Requirement Analysis creates a clear blueprint of what the system should do and how it should behave. Without this foundation, teams risk misalignment, leading to incomplete or low-quality software.

- **Enables Accurate Cost and Time Estimation:** A well-documented set of requirements helps project managers estimate resources, effort, and timelines more precisely. If requirements are vague or incomplete, cost and time projections may be unrealistic, resulting in budget overruns or missed deadlines.

- **Ensures Clarity and Understanding:** Requirement Analysis acts as a communication bridge between stakeholders (users, business managers, and the development team). It eliminates ambiguity by translating stakeholder needs into clear, structured, and testable requirements.
