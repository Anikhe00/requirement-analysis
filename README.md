# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The purpose of this repository is to practice requirement analysis, which focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analysing, and structuring requirements.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyses, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.

It is the process of identifying, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It involves understanding what the system should do, the constraints under which it must operate, and the features that will satisfy business objectives.

It is typically the first and most crucial phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), because errors or gaps at this stage can spread across the entire project, leading to wasted effort, cost overruns, or project failure.
